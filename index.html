    <h1>Welcome to the truth</h1>
    <h2>Expand your mind</h2>
    <p>
        I live on a tropical island and suddenly a large amount of imperialist troops have landed!
        This must be an outright invasion! What about my right?! What about my freedom to spread misinformation- I mean the truth!
        These troops have orders to occupy our land and we have to house them without our consent.
        We must stop this pig-barreled operation and cease all needless violence! These capitalists have gone too far. What's more is that they sent MARINES.
        Marines are recruited from prisons for bloodlust. I hear they make two recruits fight each other to the death! Despicable!
